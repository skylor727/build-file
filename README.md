# build-file

Sets the NODE_ENV environment variable to production. This tells the build system to optimize the app for production, which usually includes minification, dead code elimination, and other performance optimizations.
Runs the react-scripts build command, which is a part of the react-scripts package installed by create-react-app. This command is responsible for building the production-ready version of your React application.
Compiles and bundles your React application's JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files using Webpack, Babel, and other tools.
Optimizes and minifies the JavaScript and CSS files, making the app load faster and reducing the overall bundle size.
Generates static HTML files for each route in your app (if you're using React Router), which enables better performance and SEO.
Places the production build files in a folder called build in the root directory of your project. This folder contains all the files needed to deploy your app to a server.
